<h1><big>THE<br />
HAPPY<br />
UNFORTUNATE</big></h1>

<h2>By ROBERT SILVERBERG</h2>

<div class="tease"><i>Dekker, back from space, found great physical changes in
the people of Earth; changes that would have horrified
him five years before. But now, he wanted to be like the
rest&mdash;even if he had to lose an eye and both ears to do it.</i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Rolf Dekker</span> stared incredulously
at the slim,
handsome young Earther who
was approaching the steps of
Rolf's tumbling-down Spacertown
shack. <i>He's got no ears</i>,
Rolf noted in unbelief. After
five years in space, Rolf had
come home to a strangely-altered
world, and he found it
hard to accept.</p>

<p>Another Earther appeared.
This one was about the same
size, and gave the same impression
of fragility. This one
had ears, all right&mdash;and a pair
of gleaming, two-inch horns
on his forehead as well. <i>I'll
be eternally roasted</i>, Rolf
thought. <i>Now I've seen everything.</i></p>

<p>Both Earthers were dressed
in neat, gold-inlaid green
tunics, costumes which looked
terribly out of place amid
the filth of Spacertown, and
their hair was dyed a light
green to match.</p>

<p>He had been scrutinizing
them for several moments before
they became aware of
him. They both spotted him
at once and the one with no
ears turned to his companion
and whispered something.
Rolf, leaning forward, strained
to hear.</p>

<p>"... beautiful, isn't he?
That's the biggest one I've
seen!"</p>

<p>"Come over here, won't
you?" the horned one called,
in a soft, gentle voice which
contrasted oddly with the
raucous bellowing Rolf had
been accustomed to hearing in
space. "We'd like to talk to
you."</p>

<p>Just then Kanaday emerged
from the door of the shack
and limped down to the staircase.</p>

<div class="figr">
<img src="images/001.png" width="347" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>The doctor refused to change Dekker, so Dekker was
going to change the doctor.</small></b></div>

<p>"Hey, Rolf!" he called.
"Leave those things alone!"</p>

<p>"Let me find out what they
want first, huh?"</p>

<p>"Can't be any good, whatever
it is," Kanaday growled.
"Tell them to get out of here
before I throw them back to
wherever they came from.
And make it fast."</p>

<hr />

<p>The two Earthers looked at
each other uneasily. Rolf
walked toward them.</p>

<p>"He doesn't like Earthers,
that's all," Rolf explained.
"But he won't do anything but
yell."</p>

<p>Kanaday spat in disgust,
turned, and limped back inside
the shack.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were
wearing horns," Rolf said.</p>

<p>The Earther flushed. "New
style," he said. "Very expensive."</p>

<p>"Oh," Rolf said. "I'm new
here; I just got back. Five
years in space. When I left
you people looked all alike.
Now you wear horns."</p>

<p>"It's the new trend," said
the earless one. "We're Individs.
When you left the Conforms
were in power, style-wise.
But the new surgeons
can do almost anything, you
see."</p>

<p>The shadow of a frown
crossed Rolf's face. "Anything?"</p>

<p>"Almost. They can't transform
an Earther into a
Spacer, and they don't think
they ever will."</p>

<p>"Or vice versa?" Rolf asked.</p>

<p>They sniggered. "What
Spacer would want to become
an Earther? Who would give
up that life, out in the stars?"</p>

<p>Rolf said nothing. He kicked
at the heap of litter in the
filthy street. <i>What spacer indeed?</i>
he thought. He suddenly
realized that the two little
Earthers were staring up at
him as if he were some sort
of beast. He probably weighed
as much as both of them, he
knew, and at six-four he was
better than a foot taller. They
looked like children next to
him, like toys. The savage
blast of acceleration would
snap their flimsy bodies like
toothpicks.</p>

<p>"What places have you been
to?" the earless one asked.</p>

<p>"Two years on Mars, one
on Venus, one in the Belt, one
on Neptune," Rolf recited. "I
didn't like Neptune. It was
best in the Belt; just our one
ship, prospecting. We made a
pile on Ceres&mdash;enough to buy
out. I shot half of it on Neptune.
Still have plenty left,
but I don't know what I can
do with it." He didn't add that
he had come home puzzled,
wondering why he was a
Spacer instead of an Earther,
condemned to live in filthy
Spacertown when Yawk was
just across the river.</p>

<p>They were looking at his
shabby clothes, at the dirty
brownstone hovel he lived in&mdash;an
antique of a house four
or five centuries old.</p>

<p>"You mean you're rich?"
the Earther said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Rolf said. "Every
Spacer is. So what? What can
I spend it on? My money's
banked on Mars and Venus.
Thanks to the law I can't
legally get it to Earth. So I
live in Spacertown."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen an
Earther city?" the earless one
asked, looking around at the
quiet streets of Spacertown
with big powerful men sitting
idly in front of every house.</p>

<p>"I used to live in Yawk,"
Rolf said. "My grandmother
was an Earther; she brought
me up there. I haven't been
back there since I left for
space." <i>They forced me out of
Yawk</i>, he thought. <i>I'm not
part of their species. Not one
of them.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>The two Earthers exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>"Can we interest you in a
suggestion?" They drew in
their breath as if they expected
to be knocked sprawling.</p>

<p>Kanaday appeared at the
door of the shack again.</p>

<p>"Rolf. Hey! You turning
into an Earther? Get rid of
them two cuties before there's
trouble."</p>

<p>Rolf turned and saw a little
knot of Spacers standing on
the other side of the street,
watching him with curiosity.
He glared at them.</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever I damn
well please," he shouted
across.</p>

<p>He turned back to the two
Earthers. "Now, what is it
you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm giving a party next
week," the earless one said.
"I'd like you to come. We'd
like to get the Spacer slant on
life."</p>

<p>"Party?" Rolf repeated.
"You mean, dancing, and
games, and stuff like that?"</p>

<p>"You'll enjoy it," the
Earther said coaxingly. "And
we'd all love to have a real
Spacer there."</p>

<p>"When is it?"</p>

<p>"A week."</p>

<p>"I have ten days left of my
leave. All right," he said. "I'll
come."</p>

<p>He accepted the Earther's
card, looked at it mechanically,
saw the name&mdash;Kal Quinton&mdash;and
pocketed it. "Sure,"
he said. "I'll be there."</p>

<p>The Earthers moved toward
their little jetcar, smiling
gratefully. As Rolf crossed
the street, the other Spacers
greeted him with cold, puzzled
stares.</p>

<hr />

<p>Kanaday was almost as tall
as Rolf, and even uglier.
Rolf's eyebrows were bold and
heavy; Kanaday's, thick, contorted,
bushy clumps of hair.
Kanaday's nose had been
broken long before in some
barroom brawl; his cheekbones
bulged; his face was
strong and hard. More important,
his left foot was
twisted and gnarled beyond
hope of redemption by the
most skillful surgeon. He had
been crippled in a jet explosion
three years before, and
was of no use to the Spacelines
any more. They had pensioned
him off. Part of the
deal was the dilapidated old
house in Spacertown which he
operated as a boarding-house
for transient Spacers.</p>

<p>"What do you want to do
that for?" Kanaday asked.
"Haven't those Earthers pushed
you around enough, so you
have to go dance at one of
their wild parties?"</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," Rolf
muttered.</p>

<p>"You like this filth you live
in? Spacertown is just a
ghetto, that's all. The Earthers
have pushed you right into
the muck. You're not even a
human being to them&mdash;just
some sort of trained ape. And
now you're going to go and
entertain them. I thought you
had brains, Rolf!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" He dashed his
glass against the table; it
bounced off and dropped to
the floor, where it shattered.</p>

<p>Kanaday's girl Laney entered
the room at the sound
of the crash. She was tall and
powerful-looking, with
straight black hair and the
strong cheekbones that characterized
the Spacers. Immediately
she stooped and began
shoveling up the broken glass.</p>

<p>"That wasn't smart, Rolf,"
she said. "That'll cost you half
a credit. Wasn't worth it, was
it?"</p>

<p>Rolf laid the coin on the
edge of the table. "Tell your
pal to shut up, then. If he
doesn't stop icing me I'll fix
his other foot for him and
you can buy him a dolly."</p>

<p>She looked from one to the
other. "What's bothering you
two now?"</p>

<p>"A couple of Earthers were
here this morning," Kanaday
said. "Slumming. They took a
fancy to our young friend
here and invited him to one
of their parties. He accepted."</p>

<p>"He <i>what</i>? Don't go, Rolf.
You're crazy to go."</p>

<p>"Why am I crazy?" He
tried to control his voice.
"Why should we keep ourselves
apart from the Earthers?
Why shouldn't the two
races get together?"</p>

<hr />

<p>She put down her tray and
sat next to him. "They're
more than two races," she
said patiently. "Earther and
Spacer are two different
species, Rolf. Carefully, genetically
separated. They're
small and weak, we're big and
powerful. You've been bred
for going to space; they're the
castoffs, the ones who were
too weak to go. The line between
the two groups is too
strong to break."</p>

<p>"And they treat us like dirt&mdash;like
animals," Kanaday
said. "But <i>they're</i> the dirt.
They were the ones who
couldn't make it."</p>

<p>"Don't go to the party,"
Laney said. "They just want
to make fun of you. Look at
the big ape, they'll say."</p>

<p>Rolf stood up. "You don't
understand. Neither of you
does. I'm part Earther," Rolf
said. "My grandmother on my
mother's side. She raised me
as an Earther. She wanted me
to be an Earther. But I kept
getting bigger and uglier all
the time. She took me to a
plastic surgeon once, figuring
he could make me look like
an Earther. He was a little
man; I don't know what he
looked like to start with but
some other surgeon had made
him clean-cut and straight-nosed
and thin-lipped like all
the other Earthers. I was bigger
than he was&mdash;twice as
big, and I was only fifteen.
He looked at me and felt my
bones and measured me.
'Healthy little ape'&mdash;those
were the words he used. He
told my grandmother I'd get
bigger and bigger, that no
amount of surgery could make
me small and handsome, that
I was fit only for space and
didn't belong in Yawk. So I
left for space the next morning."</p>

<p>"I see," Laney said quietly.</p>

<p>"I didn't say good-bye. I
just left. There was no place
for me in Yawk; I couldn't
pass myself off as an Earther
any more. But I'd like to go
back and see what the old
life was like, now that I know
what it's like to be on the
other side for a while."</p>

<p>"It'll hurt when you find
out, Rolf."</p>

<p>"I'll take that chance. But I
want to go. Maybe my grandmother'll
be there. The surgeons
made her young and
pretty again every few years;
she looked like my sister when
I left."</p>

<p>Laney nodded her head.
"There's no point arguing
with him, Kanaday. He has to
go back there and find out, so
let him alone."</p>

<p>Rolf smiled. "Thanks for
understanding." He took out
Quinton's card and turned it
over and over in his hand.</p>

<hr />

<p>Rolf went to Yawk on foot,
dressed in his best clothes,
with his face as clean as it had
been in some years. Spacertown
was just across the river
from Yawk, and the bridges
spanning the river were
bright and gleaming in the
mid-afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The bombs had landed on
Yawk during the long-forgotten
war, but somehow they
had spared the sprawling
borough across the river. And
so Yawk had been completely
rebuilt, once the radioactivity
had been purged from the
land, while what was now
Spacertown consisted mostly
of buildings that dated back
to the Twentieth Century.</p>

<p>Yawk had been the world's
greatest seaport; now it was
the world's greatest spaceport.
The sky was thick with
incoming and outgoing liners.
The passengers on the ship
usually stayed at Yawk, which
had become an even greater
metropolis than it had been
before the Bomb. The crew
crossed the river to Spacertown,
where they could find
their own kind.</p>

<p>Yawk and Spacertown were
like two separate planets.
There were three bridges
spanning the river, but most
of the time they went unused,
except by spacemen going
back home or by spacemen
going to the spaceport for
embarkation. There was no
regular transportation between
the two cities; to get
from Spacertown to Yawk,
you could borrow a jetcar or
you could walk. Rolf walked.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the trip. <i>I'm
going back home</i>, he thought
as he paced along the gleaming
arc of the bridge, dressed
in his Sunday best. He remembered
the days of his
own childhood, his parentless
childhood. His earliest memory
was of a fight at the age
of six or so. He had stood off
what seemed like half the
neighborhood, ending the battle
by picking up an older
bully, much feared by everyone,
and heaving him over a
fence. When he told his grandmother
about the way he had
won the fight she cried for an
hour, and never told him why.
But they had never picked on
him again, though he knew
the other boys had jeered at
him behind his back as he
grew bigger and bigger over
the years. "Ape," they called
him. "Ape."</p>

<p>But never to his face.</p>

<p>He approached the Yawk
end of the bridge. A guard
was waiting there&mdash;an Earther
guard, small and frail, but
with a sturdy-looking blaster
at his hip.</p>

<p>"Going back, Spacer?"</p>

<p>Rolf started. How did the
guard know? And then he
realized that all the guard
meant was, are you going
back to your ship?</p>

<p>"No. No, I'm going to a
party. Kal Quinton's house."</p>

<p>"Tell me another, Spacer."
The guard's voice was light
and derisive. A swift poke in
the ribs would break him in
half, Rolf thought.</p>

<p>"I'm serious. Quinton invited
me. Here's his card."</p>

<p>"If this is a joke it'll mean
trouble. But go ahead; I'll
take your word for it."</p>

<p>Rolf marched on past the
guard, almost nonchalantly.
He looked at the address on
the card. <i>12406 Kenman Road.</i>
He rooted around in his fading
memory of Yawk, but he
found the details had blurred
under the impact of five years
of Mars and Venus and the
Belt and Neptune. He did not
know where Kenman Road
was.</p>

<p>The glowing street signs
were not much help either.
One said 287th Street and the
other said 72nd Avenue. Kenman
Road might be anywhere.</p>

<p>He walked on a block or
two. The streets were antiseptically
clean, and he had
the feeling that his boots,
which had lately trod in
Spacertown, were leaving
dirtmarks along the street.
He did not look back to see.</p>

<hr />

<p>He looked at his wristchron.
It was getting late, and Kenman
Road might be anywhere.
He turned into a busy thoroughfare,
conscious that he
was attracting attention. The
streets here were crowded
with little people who barely
reached his chest; they were
all about the same height, and
most of them looked alike. A
few had had radical surgical
alterations, and every one of
these was different. One had
a unicorn-like horn; another,
an extra eye which cunningly
resembled his real ones. The
Earthers were looking at him
furtively, as they would at a
tiger or an elephant strolling
down a main street.</p>

<p>"Where are you going,
Spacer?" said a voice from
the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Rolf's first impulse was to
snarl out a curse and keep
moving, but he realized that
the question was a good one
and one whose answer he was
trying to find out for himself.
He turned.</p>

<p>Another policeman stood on
the edge of the walkway.
"Are you lost?" The policeman
was short and delicate-looking.</p>

<p>Rolf produced his card.</p>

<p>The policeman studied it.
"What business do you have
with Quinton?"</p>

<p>"Just tell me how to get
there," Rolf said. "I'm in a
hurry."</p>

<p>The policeman backed up a
step. "All right, take it easy."
He pointed to a kiosk. "Take
the subcar here. There's a
stop at Kenman Road. You
can find your way from
there."</p>

<p>"I'd rather walk it," Rolf
said. He did not want to have
to stand the strain of riding
in a subcar with a bunch of
curious staring Earthers.</p>

<p>"Fine with me," the policeman
said. "It's about two
hundred blocks to the north.
Got a good pair of legs?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," Rolf said.
"I'll take the subcar."</p>

<hr />

<p>Kenman Road was a quiet
little street in an expensive-looking
end of Yawk. 12406
was a towering building
which completely overshadowed
everything else on the
street. As Rolf entered the
door, a perfumed little Earther
with a flashing diamond
where his left eye should have
been and a skin stained bright
purple appeared from nowhere.</p>

<p>"We've been waiting for
you. Come on; Kal will be delighted
that you're here."</p>

<p>The elevator zoomed up so
quickly that Rolf thought for
a moment that he was back
in space. But it stopped suddenly
at the 62nd floor, and,
as the door swung open, the
sounds of wild revelry drifted
down the hall. Rolf had a
brief moment of doubt when
he pictured Laney and Kanaday
at this very moment,
playing cards in their mouldering
hovel while he walked
down this plastiline corridor
back into a world he had left
behind.</p>

<p>Quinton came out into the
hall to greet him. Rolf recognized
him by the missing
ears; his skin was now a subdued
blue to go with his
orange robe.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you came," the
little Earther bubbled. "Come
on in and I'll introduce you
to everyone."</p>

<p>The door opened photoelectrically
as they approached.
Quinton seized him by the
hand and dragged him in.
There was the sound of laughter
and of shouting. As he entered
it all stopped, suddenly,
as if it had been shut off. Rolf
stared at them quizzically
from under his lowering
brows, and they looked at him
with ill-concealed curiosity.</p>

<p>They seemed divided into
two groups. Clustered at one
end of the long hall was a
group of Earthers who seemed
completely identical, all
with the same features, looking
like so many dolls in a
row. These were the Earthers
he remembered, the ones
whom the plastic surgeons
had hacked at and hewn until
they all conformed to the prevailing
concept of beauty.</p>

<p>Then at the other end was
a different group. They were
all different. Some had glittering
jewels set in their foreheads,
others had no lips, no
hair, extra eyes, three nostrils.
They were a weird and
frightening group, highest
product of the plastic surgeon's
art.</p>

<p>Both groups were staring
silently at Rolf.</p>

<p>"Friends, this is Rolf&mdash;Rolf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dekker," Rolf said after a
pause. He had almost forgotten
his own last name.</p>

<p>"Rolf Dekker, just back
from outer space. I've invited
him to join us tonight. I think
you'll enjoy meeting him."</p>

<p>The stony silence slowly
dissolved into murmurs of
polite conversation as the
party-goers adjusted to the
presence of the newcomer.
They seemed to be discussing
the matter earnestly among
themselves, as if Quinton had
done something unheard-of by
bringing a Spacer into an
Earther party.</p>

<p>A tall girl with blonde hair
drifted up to him.</p>

<p>"Ah. Jonne," Quinton said.
He turned to Rolf. "This is
Jonne. She asked to be your
companion at the party. She's
very interested in space and
things connected with it."</p>

<p>Things connected with it,
Rolf thought. Meaning me.
He looked at her. She was as
tall an Earther as he had yet
seen, and probably suffered
for it when there were no
Spacers around. Furthermore,
he suspected, her height was
accentuated for the evening
by special shoes. She was not
of the Individ persuasion, because
her face was well-shaped,
with smooth, even
features, with no individualist
distortion. Her skin was unstained.
She wore a clinging
off-the-breast tunic. Quite a
dish, Rolf decided. He began
to see that he might enjoy
this party.</p>

<hr />

<p>The other guests began to
approach timidly, now that
the initial shock of his presence
had worn off. They asked
silly little questions about
space&mdash;questions which showed
that they had only a superficial
interest in him and were
treating him as a sort of talking
dog. He answered as
many as he could, looking
down at their little painted
faces with concealed contempt.</p>

<p><i>They think as little of me
as I do of them.</i> The thought
hit him suddenly and his
broad face creased in a smile
at the irony. Then the music
started.</p>

<hr />

<p>The knot of Earthers slowly
broke up and drifted away to
dance. He looked at Jonne,
who had stood patiently at
his side through all this.</p>

<p>"I don't dance," he said. "I
never learned how." He
watched the other couples
moving gracefully around the
floor, looking for all the world
like an assemblage of puppets.
He stared in the dim light,
watching the couples clinging
to each other as they rocked
through the motions of the
dance. He stood against the
wall, wearing his ugliness like
a shield. He saw the great
gulf which separated him
from the Earthers spreading
before him, as he watched the
dancers and the gay chatter
and the empty badinage and
the furtive hand-holding, and
everything else from which he
was cut off. The bizarre Individs
were dancing together&mdash;he
noticed one man putting
an extra arm to full advantage&mdash;and
the almost identical
Conforms had formed their
own group again. Rolf wondered
how they told each other
apart when they all looked
alike.</p>

<p>"Come on," Jonne said. "I'll
show you how to dance." He
turned to look at her, with
her glossy blonde hair and
even features. She smiled
prettily, revealing white teeth.
<i>Probably newly purchased?</i>
Rolf wondered.</p>

<p>"Actually I do know how to
dance," Rolf said. "But I do
it so badly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," she
said gaily. "Come on."</p>

<p>She took his arm. Maybe
she doesn't think I look like
an ape, he thought. She
doesn't treat me the way the
others do. But why am I so
ugly, and why is she so
pretty?</p>

<p>He looked at her and she
looked at him, and he felt her
glance on his stubbly face
with its ferocious teeth and
burning yellowish eyes. He
didn't want her to see him at
all; he wished he had no face.</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms,
feeling her warmth radiate
through him. She was very
tall, he realized, almost as tall
as a Spacer woman&mdash;but with
none of the harsh ruggedness
of the women of Spacertown.
They danced, she well, he
clumsily. When the music
stopped she guided him to the
entrance of a veranda.</p>

<p>They walked outside into
the cool night air. The lights
of the city obscured most of
the stars, but a few still
showed, and the moon hung
high above Yawk. He could
dimly make out the lights of
Spacertown across the river,
and he thought again of
Laney and Kanaday and wished
Kanaday could see him now
with this beautiful Earther
next to him.</p>

<p>"You must get lonely in
space," she said after a while.</p>

<p>"I do," he said, trying to
keep his voice gentle. "But it's
where I belong. I'm bred for
it."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes. And any
of those so-called men inside
would give ten years of his
life to be able to go to space.
But yet you say it's lonely."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Those long rides through
the night," he said. "They get
you down. You want to be
back among people. So you
come back. You come back.
And what do you come back
to?"</p>

<p>"I know," she said softly.
"I've seen Spacertown."</p>

<p>"Why must it be that way?"
he demanded. "Why are
Spacers so lucky and so
wretched all at once?"</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about it
now," she said.</p>

<p>I'd like to kiss her, he
thought. But my face is rough,
and I'm rough and ugly, and
she'd push me away. I remember
the pretty little Earther
girls who ran laughing away
from me when I was thirteen
and fourteen, before I went
to space.</p>

<p>"You don't have to be lonely,"
she said. One of her perfect
eyebrows lifted just a
little. "Maybe someday you'll
find someone who cares, Rolf.
Someday, maybe."</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said. "Someday,
maybe." But he knew it was
all wrong. Could he bring this
girl to Spacertown with him?
No; she must be merely playing
a game, looking for an
evening's diversion. Something
new: make love to a
Spacer.</p>

<p>They fell silent and he
watched her again, and she
watched him. He heard her
breath rising and falling
evenly, not at all like his own
thick gasps. After a while he
stepped close to her, put his
arm around her, tilted her
head into the crook of his
elbow, bent, and kissed her.</p>

<p>As he did it, he saw he was
botching it just like everything
else. He had come too
close, and his heavy boot was
pressing on the tip of her
shoe; and he had not quite
landed square on her lips. But
still, he was close to her. He
was reluctant to break it up,
but he felt she was only half-responding,
not giving anything
of herself while he had
given all. He drew back a step.</p>

<p>She did not have time to
hide the expression of distaste
that involuntarily crossed
her face. He watched the
expression on her face as she
realized the kiss was over. He
watched her silently.</p>

<p>"Someday, maybe," he said.
She stared at him, not hiding
the fear that was starting to
grow on her face.</p>

<p>He felt a cold chill deep in
his stomach, and it grew until
it passed through his throat
and into his head.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said. "Someday,
maybe. But not you. Not anyone
who's just playing games.
That's all&mdash;you want something
to tell your friends
about, that's why you volunteered
for tonight's assignment.
It's all you can do to
keep from laughing at me,
but you're sticking to it. I
don't want any of it, hear me?
Get away."</p>

<p>She stepped back a pace.
"You ugly, clumsy clown.
You ape!" Tears began to
spoil the flawless mask of her
face. Blinded with anger, he
grabbed roughly for her arm,
but she broke away and dashed
back inside.</p>

<p>She was trying to collect
me, he thought. Her hobby:
interesting dates. She wanted
to add me to her collection. An
Experience. Calmly he walked
to the end of the veranda and
stared off into the night, choking
his rage. He watched the
moon making its dead ride
across the sky, and stared at
the sprinkling of stars. The
night was empty and cold, he
thought, finally. But not more
so than I.</p>

<hr />

<p>He turned and looked back
through the half-opened window.
He saw a girl who looked
almost like her, but was not
tall enough and wore a different
dress. Then he spotted
her. She was dancing with one
of the Conforms, a frail-looking
man a few inches shorter
than she, with regular, handsome
features. She laughed at
some sly joke, and he laughed
with her.</p>

<p>Rolf watched the moon for
a moment more, thinking of
Laney's warning. <i>They just
want to make fun of you.
Look at the big ape, they'll
say.</i></p>

<p>He knew he had to get out
of there immediately. He was
a Spacer, and they were
Earthers, and he scorned
them for being contemptuous
little dolls, and they laughed
at him for being a hulking
ape. He was not a member of
their species; he was not part
of their world.</p>

<p>He went inside. Kal Quinton
came rushing up to him.</p>

<p>"I'm going," Rolf said.</p>

<p>"What? You don't mean
that," the little man said.
"Why, the party's scarcely
gotten under way, and there
are dozens of people who want
to meet you. And you'll miss
the big show if you don't
stay."</p>

<p>"I've already seen the big
show," Rolf told him. "I want
out. Now."</p>

<p>"You can't leave now,"
Quinton said. Rolf thought he
saw tears in the corners of the
little man's eyes. "Please don't
leave. I've told everyone you'd
be here&mdash;you'll disgrace me."</p>

<p>"What do I care? Let me
out of here." Rolf started to
move toward the door. Quinton
attempted to push him
back.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Rolf.
Please!"</p>

<p>"I have to get out," he said.
He knocked Quinton out of
his way with a backhand
swipe of his arm and dashed
down the hall frantically,
looking for the elevator.</p>

<hr />

<p>Laney and Kanaday were
sitting up waiting for him
when he got back, early in the
morning. He slung himself
into a pneumochair and unsealed
his boots, releasing his
cramped, tired feet.</p>

<p>"Well," Laney asked. "How
was the party?"</p>

<p>"You have fun among the
Earthers, Rolf?"</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been that
bad," Laney said.</p>

<p>Rolf looked up at her. "I'm
leaving space. I'm going to go
to a surgeon and have him
turn me into an Earther. I
hate this filthy life!"</p>

<p>"He's drunk," Kanaday
said.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not drunk," Rolf
retorted. "I don't want to be
an ape any more."</p>

<p>"Is that what you are? If
you're an ape, what are they
to you? Monkeys?" Kanaday
laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Are they really so wonderful?"
Laney asked. "Does the
life appeal to you so much
that you'll give up space for
it? Do you admire the Earthers
so much?"</p>

<hr />

<p><i>She's got me</i>, Rolf thought.
I hate Spacertown, but will I
like Yawk any better? Do I
really want to become one of
those little puppets? But
there's nothing left in space
for me. At least the Earthers
are happy.</p>

<p><i>I wish she wouldn't look at
me that way.</i> "Leave me
alone," he snarled. "I'll do
whatever I want to do." Laney
was staring at him, trying to
poke behind his mask of
anger. He looked at her wide
shoulders, her muscular
frame, her unbeautiful hair
and rugged face, and compared
it with Jonne's clinging
grace, her flowing gold hair.</p>

<p>He picked up his boots and
stumped up to bed.</p>

<hr />

<p>The surgeon's name was
Goldring, and he was a wiry,
intense man who had prevailed
on one of his colleagues to
give him a tiny slit of a
mouth. He sat behind a shining
plastiline desk, waiting
patiently until Rolf finished
talking.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," he said
at last. "Plastic surgeons can
do almost anything, but I
can't turn you into an Earther.
It's not just a matter of
chopping eight or ten inches
out of your legs; I'd have to
alter your entire bone structure
or you'd be a hideous
misproportioned monstrosity.
And it can't be done. I can't
build you a whole new body
from scratch, and if I could
do it you wouldn't be able to
afford it."</p>

<p>Rolf stamped his foot impatiently.
"You're the third
surgeon who's given me the
same line. What is this&mdash;a
conspiracy? I see what you
can do. If you can graft a
third arm onto somebody, you
can turn me into an Earther."</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Dekker. I've
told you I can't. But I don't
understand why you want
such a change. Hardly a week
goes by without some Yawk
boy coming to me and asking
to be turned into a Spacer,
and I have to refuse him for
the same reasons I'm refusing
you! That's the usual course
of events&mdash;the romantic
Earther boy wanting to go to
space, and not being able to."</p>

<p>An idea hit Rolf. "Was one
of them Kal Quinton?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Dekker. I
just can't divulge any such
information."</p>

<p>Rolf shot his arm across the
desk and grasped the surgeon
by the throat. "Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," the surgeon gasped.
"Quinton asked me for such
an operation. Almost everyone
wants one."</p>

<p>"And you can't do it?" Rolf
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not. I've told
you: the amount of work
needed to turn Earther into
Spacer or Spacer into Earther
is inconceivable. It'll never be
done."</p>

<p>"I guess that's definite,
then," Rolf said, slumping a
little in disappointment. "But
there's nothing to prevent you
from giving me a new face&mdash;from
taking away this face
and replacing it with something
people can look at without
shuddering."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you,
Mr. Dekker," the surgeon
said.</p>

<p>"I know that! Can't you see
it&mdash;I'm <i>ugly</i>! Why? Why
should I look this way?"</p>

<p>"Please calm down, Mr.
Dekker. You don't seem to realize
that you're a perfectly
normal-looking Spacer. <i>You
were bred to look this way.</i>
It's your genetic heritage.
Space is not a thing for everyone;
only men with extraordinary
bone structure can
withstand acceleration. The
first men were carefully selected
and bred. You see the
result of five centuries of this
sort of breeding. The sturdy,
heavy-boned Spacers&mdash;you,
Mr. Dekker, and your friends&mdash;are
the only ones who are
fit to travel in space. The
others, the weaklings like myself,
the little people, resort
to plastic surgery to compensate
for their deficiency. For
a while the trend was to have
everyone conform to a certain
standard of beauty; if we
couldn't be strong, we could
at least be handsome. Lately
a new theory of individualism
has sprung up, and now we
strive for original forms in
our bodies. This is all because
size and strength has been
bred out of us and given to
you."</p>

<p>"I know all this," Rolf said.
"Why can't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why can't I peel away
your natural face and make
you look like an Earther?
There's no reason why; it
would be a simple operation.
But who would you fool? Why
can't you be grateful for what
you are? You can go to Mars,
while we can merely look at
it. If I gave you a new face,
it would cut you off from both
sides. The Earthers would
still know you were a Spacer,
and I'm sure the other
Spacers would immediately
cease to associate with you."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Who are you to say?
You're not supposed to pass
judgment on whether an operation
should be performed, or
you wouldn't pull out people's
eyes and stick diamonds in!"</p>

<p>"It's not that, Mr. Dekker."
The surgeon folded and unfolded
his hands in impatience.
"You must realize that
you are what you are. Your
appearance is a social norm,
and for acceptance in your
social environment you must
continue to appear, well, perhaps,
shall I say apelike?"</p>

<p>It was as bad a word as the
surgeon could have chosen.</p>

<p>"Ape! Ape, am I! I'll show
you who's an ape!" Rolf yelled,
all the accumulated frustration
of the last two days
suddenly bursting loose. He
leaped up and overturned the
desk. Dr. Goldring hastily
jumped backwards as the
heavy desk crashed to the
floor. A startled nurse dashed
into the office, saw the situation,
and immediately ran out.</p>

<p>"Give me your instruments!
I'll operate on myself!" He
knocked Goldring against the
wall, pulled down a costly
solidograph from the wall and
kicked it at him, and crashed
through into the operating
room, where he began overturning
tables and heaving
chairs through glass shelves.</p>

<p>"I'll show you," he said. He
cracked an instrument case
and took out a delicate knife
with a near-microscopic edge.
He bent it in half and threw
the crumpled wreckage away.
Wildly he destroyed everything
he could, raging from
one end of the room to the
other, ripping down furnishings,
smashing, destroying,
while Dr. Goldring stood at
the door and yelled for help.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming.
An army of Earther policemen
erupted into the room
and confronted him as he
stood panting amid the wreckage.
They were all short men,
but there must have been
twenty of them.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him," someone
called. And then they advanced
in a body.</p>

<p>He picked up the operating
table and hurled it at them.
Three policemen crumpled
under it, but the rest kept
coming. He batted them away
like insects, but they surrounded
him and piled on. For
a few moments he struggled
under the load of fifteen small
men, punching and kicking
and yelling. He burst loose
for an instant, but two of
them were clinging to his legs
and he hit the floor with a
crash. They were on him immediately,
and he stopped
struggling after a while.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next thing he knew he
was lying sprawled on the
floor of his room in Spacertown,
breathing dust out of
the tattered carpet. He was a
mass of cuts and bruises, and
he knew they must have given
him quite a going-over. He
was sore from head to foot.</p>

<p>So they hadn't arrested
him. No, of course not; no
more than they would arrest
any wild animal who went
berserk. They had just dumped
him back in the jungle. He
tried to get up, but couldn't
make it. Quite a going-over it
must have been. Nothing
seemed broken, but everything
was slightly bent.</p>

<p>"Satisfied now?" said a
voice from somewhere. It was
a pleasant sound to hear, a
voice, and he let the mere
noise of it soak into his mind.
"Now that you've proved to
everyone that you really are
just an ape?"</p>

<p>He twisted his neck around&mdash;slowly,
because his neck
was stiff and sore. Laney was
sitting on the edge of his bed
with two suitcases next to her.</p>

<p>"It really wasn't necessary
to run wild there," she said.
"The Earthers all knew you
were just an animal anyway.
You didn't have to prove it so
violently."</p>

<p>"Okay, Laney. Quit it."</p>

<p>"If you want me to. I just
wanted to make sure you
knew what had happened. A
gang of Earther cops brought
you back a while ago and
dumped you here. They told
me the story."</p>

<p>"Leave me alone."</p>

<p>"You've been telling everyone
that all along, Rolf. Look
where it got you. A royal beating
at the hands of a bunch
of Earthers. Now that they've
thrown you out for the last
time, has it filtered into your
mind that this is where you
belong?"</p>

<p>"In Spacertown?"</p>

<p>"Only between trips. You
belong in space, Rolf. No surgeon
can make you an Earther.
The Earthers are dead,
but they don't know it yet. All
their parties, their fancy
clothes, their extra arms and
missing ears&mdash;that means
they're decadent. They're finished.
You're the one who's
alive; the whole universe is
waiting for you to go out and
step on its neck. And instead
you want to turn yourself into
a green-skinned little monkey!
Why?"</p>

<hr />

<p>He pulled himself to a sitting
position. "I don't know,"
he said. "I've been all mixed
up, I think." He felt his powerful
arm. "I'm a Spacer."
Suddenly he glanced at her.
"What are the suitcases for?"
he said.</p>

<p>"I'm moving in," Laney
said. "I need a place to sleep."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with
Kanaday? Did he get tired of
listening to you preaching?
He's my friend, Laney; I'm
not going to do him dirt."</p>

<p>"He's dead, Rolf. When the
Earther cops came here to
bring you back, and he saw
what they did to you, his
hatred overflowed. He always
hated Earthers, and he hated
them even more for the way
you were being tricked into
thinking they were worth anything.
He got hold of one of
those cops and just about
twisted him into two pieces.
They blasted him."</p>

<p>Rolf was silent. He let his
head sink down on his knees.</p>

<p>"So I moved down here. It's
lonely upstairs now. Come on;
I'll help you get up."</p>

<p>She walked toward him,
hooked her hand under his
arm, and half-dragged, half-pushed
him to his feet. Her
touch was firm, and there was
no denying the strength behind
her.</p>

<p>"I have to get fixed up," he
said abruptly. "My leave's up
in two days. I have to get out
of here. We're shipping for
Pluto."</p>

<hr />

<p>He rocked unsteadily on his
feet. "It'll really get lonely
here then," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you really going to go?
Or are you going to find some
jack-surgeon who'll make
your face pretty for a few
dirty credits?"</p>

<p>"Stop it. I mean it. I'm
going. I'll be gone a year on
this signup. By then I'll have
enough cash piled up on various
planets to be a rich man.
I'll get it all together and get
a mansion on Venus, and have
Greenie slaves."</p>

<p>It was getting toward noon.
The sun, high in the sky, burst
through the shutters and lit
up the dingy room.</p>

<p>"I'll stay here," Laney said.
"You're going to Pluto?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Kanaday was supposed to
be going to Pluto. He was
heading there when that explosion
finished his foot. He
never got there after that."</p>

<p>"Poor old Kanaday," Rolf
said.</p>

<p>"I'll miss him too. I guess
I'll have to run the boarding-house
now. For a while. Will
you come back here when your
year's up?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Rolf said
without looking up. "This
town is no worse than any of
the other Spacertowns. No
better, but no worse." He
slowly lifted his head and
looked at her as she stood
there facing him.</p>

<p>"I hope you come back,"
she said.</p>

<p>The sun was coming in
from behind her, now, and
lighting her up. She was
rugged, all right, and strong:
a good hard worker. And she
was well built. Suddenly his
aches became less painful, as
he looked at her and realized
that she was infinitely more
beautiful than the slick,
glossy-looking girl he had
kissed on the veranda, who
had bought her teeth at a
store and had gotten her figure
from a surgeon. Laney, at
least, was real.</p>

<p>"You know," he said at last,
"I think I have an idea. You
wait here and I'll come get
you when my year's up. I'll
have enough to pay passage
to Venus for two. We can get
a slightly smaller mansion
than I planned on getting. But
we can get it. Some parts of
Venus are beautiful. And the
closest those monkeys from
Yawk can get to it is to look
at it in the night sky. You
think it's a good idea?"</p>

<p>"I think it's a great idea,"
she said, moving toward him.
Her head was nearly as high
as his own.</p>

<p>"I'll go back to space. I
have to, to keep my rating.
But you'll wait for me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait."</p>

<p>And as he drew her close,
he knew she meant it.</p>
